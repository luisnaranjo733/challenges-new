# Map Challenge: Police Shootings

This folder contains your submission for the [map challenge](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/challenges/map). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What information does your visualization show? What 'argument' are you making? #####
> My visualization shows a graphical distribution of police brutality events, which you can filter by the event's outcome (death, injury, or unknown). You can see statistics on how many of the filtered events were male or female. The argument it is making is that males are more likely to be victims of police brutality.

##### 2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I added the fitBounds() functionality

##### 3. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> Got help from Joel on slack!

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> Answer goes here!

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> In order to update the statistics based on the visible group layers, I had to attach the json event object with its corresponding marker by adding the json object to a new property of the marker. This was not intuitive, and took me a while to figure out.
