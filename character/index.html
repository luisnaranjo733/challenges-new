    <p>Jon Snow is a G. He is the bastard son of Ned Stark, the Warden of the North, and noble leader of House Stark.
        His birth mother is a mystery, but he was raised by Catlyn Stark, who could never bring herself to love him,
        and would often blame things on him. Despite a tough upbringing, Jon has proven to be an intelligent, brave,
        noble, and skilled warrior. He rose to the rank of Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, before being stabbed
        to death by his own men, who disagreed with his strategy.

    <p>Jon Snow is one of the central characters in <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones">A Game of Thrones</a>. GoT is the most successful show ever to run on HBO. The latest season will come out at the end of this year. If you liked Lord of The Rings, you will probably like A Game of Thrones. Check it out!
