<!--
Shows a "detail" page for an individual bean that is sold. This page should include the name, description, and picture of the bean. Note that the route includes the id of the particular bean.

Include an "About the Grower" section including the description, image, and the external link to more information (which is an attribution to where your professor got these descriptions).

The bean detail page should also include an order form so the customer can add that product to their shopping cart. They should be able to indicate how many pounds they desire (minimum of 1, maximum of 10, whole point increments) and what kind of grind they need (Whole Bean, Espresso, French Press, Cone Drip Filter, or Flat Bottom Filter). See below for more details about the shopping cart.

    <h3>Camiseta Estate</h3>
    <img src="http://0.0.0.0:8000/img/growers/camiseta.jpg">
    <p>This coffee is from Camiseta Estate in the Boquete region of Panama. Boquete is located in the lush mountain highlands of Panama, along the Caldera river (aptly named 'Caldera', a type of volcano, and runs through Boquete and Volcan Baru National Park - that's the volcano in the background of the first pic). Boquete itself sits at about 1200 meters, and the soft slopes of Baru Volcano (not to mention nutrient rich soil) provide prime coffee growing conditions. Camiseta is one of a group of estates owned and operated by a single family in the region. The altitudes range from a low of 1300 to right around 2000 meters above sea level. 80% of the trees planted are older Typica varieties.</p>
