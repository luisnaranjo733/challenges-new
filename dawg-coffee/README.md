##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> I was unsure as to how close my site should look when compared to the pictures. Following the instructions to the letter leads to the site looking a little bit different, so future students will probably be confused if that is OK or if they should put in extra work to get all the formatting to look like the pictures (I ran into this, err'ed on the side of formatting it to look the same).
